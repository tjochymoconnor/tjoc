I am a Sherman Fairchild Fellow of the [Walter Burke Institute for Theoretical Physics](http://burkeinstitute.caltech.edu/) and a member of the [Institute for Quantum Information & Matter](http://iqim.caltech.edu/) at the [California Institute of Technology](http://www.caltech.edu/).

My primary research interests are in the areas of quantum error correction, fault-tolerant quantum computation, and topological codes.

Previously, I received my MSc and PhD in Physics from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) and [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/), under the supervision
of [Raymond Laflamme](https://laflamme.iqc.ca/). I obtained my BSc in Honours Mathematics and Physics from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/).
